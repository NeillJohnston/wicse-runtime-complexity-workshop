# wicse-runtime-complexity-workshop

Code behind a runtime complexity workshop for UF WiCSE's Code-a-thon.

## Setup

You'll need to install two Python libraries, first: `openpyxl` and `matplotlib`.

```
pip3 install openpyxl matplotlib
```

(This might not work for everyone, consult the documentation for the two libraries if you have issues.)

## Running

```
sudo ./missing.sh <responses sheet>
```

The responses sheet from when the workshop ran can be downloaded here:
- [Workshop 1, @ 2:35pm](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vlKUJlLSxp0IcuRPiPw1f60hJNZrtWb1DgQpSfAuVEQ/edit?usp=sharing)
- [Workshop 2, @ 3:10pm](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1p3BK4tbpDK_5ud0tFNYoTKGXedvx5tjCFPBvGKqdTc8/edit?usp=sharing)

There's also an existing responses.xlsx document, which has all of the responses I used for testing.
